# Object Detection Scripts 🚀

This repository contains Python scripts for object detection using OpenCV and Haar Cascade classifiers. Three scripts are included:

1. **Image Object Detection**: Detects objects in a static image.
2. **Video Object Detection**: Detects objects in a video file.
3. **Webcam Object Detection**: Detects objects in real-time using the webcam.

## Requirements 📋

- Python 3.x
- Python libraries: OpenCV (cv2)
- Haar Cascade XML files for object detection (included in OpenCV)

## Installation 🔧

1. Clone this repository or download the individual script files.
2. Install OpenCV library by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```
    pip install opencv-python
    ```

## Usage 📄

### 1. Image Object Detection
- Run the script `image_detection.py`.
- Detected objects will be highlighted with rectangles on the image.

### 2. Video Object Detection
- Run the script `video_detection.py` and provide the path to the video file.
- Detected objects will be highlighted with rectangles on each frame of the video.

### 3. Webcam Object Detection
- Run the script `webcam_detection.py`.
- Detected objects will be highlighted with rectangles in real-time using your webcam.

The pop-up screen will remain open until any key is pressed.

## Examples 📷

Example screenshots or videos demonstrating the object detection results can be found in the `media` folder.
